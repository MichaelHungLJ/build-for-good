You can play it online [here](https://build-for-good.web.app/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses Firebase for the backend.

# About

This project was built for the Open Government Product's 2023 Build-for-Good Hackathon. Build for Good was a month-long hackathon organised by Open Government Products for citizens to build solutions that tackle various problems in Singapore.

In this game, players have to decide if a message they received is a scam or not. These messages were adapted from real life scam messages and promotional messages that our team received. We wanted to create a quick and easy mobile-first game that could be played within 5 minutes.

They get points for correctly categorising the message and tips on how to spot scams.

If players get it wrong, they are notified of the type of scam they fell for, how to identify these scams, and the consequences of the scam.

Finally, players can share the link to the game with their friends and family.
