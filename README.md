This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses Firebase for the backend.

# About

This project was built for the Open Government Product's 2023 Build-for-Good Hackathon. Build for Good was a month-long hackathon organised by Open Government Products for citizens to build solutions that tackle various problems in Singapore. 

In this game, players have to decide if a message they received is a scam or not. These messages were adapted from real life scam messages and promotional messages that our team received.

They get points for correctly categorising the message.
